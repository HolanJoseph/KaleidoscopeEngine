	This is a snapshot of my engine. This project is representitive of my work, 
but this is taken from a rapidly evolving project so while most files are representitive
of my work some no longer are. As I continue working I will update the list of files that need
to be refactored, and are no longer representitive of my current work level.

Refactor List
