	This is a snapshot of my engine. This project is representitive of my work, 
but this is taken from a rapidly evolving project so while most files are representitive
of my work some no longer are. As I continue working I will update the list of files that need
to be refactored, and are no longer representitive of my current work level. than others. For example 
the lua math, transform, gameobject, luascript libs 
are very old and are on the list to be refactored , so they are no longer representitive of 
my Lua C api programming abilities.
